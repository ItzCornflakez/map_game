The Religion of the Empire
Name: The Radiant Covenant
Core Belief: The empire’s religion centers around a pantheon of deities known as the Celestial Assembly, who represent natural elements, virtues, and cosmic forces. The pantheon is led by Lumara, the goddess of light, unity, and the sacred lake, considered the divine protector of the empire.

Major Deities of the Celestial Assembly:
Lumara (Goddess of Light and Unity): Patron deity of the empire, symbolized by the sun and sacred lake.
Kaelith (God of the Forge and Creation): Revered by dwarves and artisans.
Nyvara (Goddess of Shadows and Secrets): Worshiped in secret by dark elves and spies.
Tharok (God of Strength and War): Patron of warriors, often depicted as an armored orc.
Velessa (Goddess of Nature and Fertility): Beloved by farmers, halflings, and druids.
Core Practices:
Pilgrimages: Devout followers journey to the sacred lake, where Lumara is said to have descended to bless the empire.
Holy Days: Celebrations align with celestial events, such as eclipses, solstices, and harvest moons.
Ritual Offerings: Sacrifices of crafted goods, crops, or symbolic tokens are made at temples dedicated to individual deities.

ACA = After celestial assembly
Start date: 1100 ACA( Celebration of the 11th century of celestial assembly order)

The Age of Harmony (1100-1160 ACA)
Reform: The empire officially adopts the Radiant Covenant as the state religion, elevating Lumara to supreme status.
Impact: Centralized worship strengthens unity across the empire but marginalizes smaller cults, sowing seeds of future dissent.
Religious Unity: Temples dedicated to lesser deities are incorporated into a central network, ensuring consistency in rituals and doctrine.


The Dawn of the Shattered Faith (1160 ACA)
Event: A charismatic prophet named Elandar the Luminescent, claiming divine visions from Lumara, calls for her elevation as the sole true deity. He denounces the Celestial Assembly as "false idols."
Impact:
Lumara’s worshippers split from the Radiant Covenant, forming the Church of the Eternal Light. They reject all other gods, claiming the sacred lake as Lumara’s earthly manifestation.
The imperial court initially supports the movement, seeing it as a way to centralize religious power.
Consequence: Worshippers of other deities feel betrayed and begin forming their own offshoots, creating fractures within the empire.

The War of the Fractured Sky (1170-1220 ACA)
Event: The other deities’ followers resist Lumara's exclusive worship, leading to a series of conflicts:
Kaelith’s Followers: The Brotherhood of the Eternal Forge declares independence in the western mountains, claiming Kaelith as the empire’s true creator.
Nyvara’s Shadowed Faith: The Shadowed Choir allies with dark elf communities, spreading a shadow-based doctrine that rejects the light entirely.
Velessa’s Verdant Crusade: The Verdant Circle mobilizes rural communities, demanding respect for the natural world and Velessa’s supremacy.
Tharok’s Warlords: Orcish tribes unite under the Banner of Iron Blood, declaring Tharok the ultimate warrior god.
Conflict:
Entire duchies align with specific deities, turning the empire into a patchwork of warring states.
The sacred lake becomes a battlefield, with each faction seeking to claim it as proof of their god’s favor.

The Treaty of Radiant Ashes (1220 ACA)
Event: After decades of war, the empire forces a fragile peace with the Treaty of Radiant Ashes:
Each major deity is granted its own autonomous religious domain within the empire, formalizing their followers’ independence.
The sacred lake is declared neutral territory, controlled by a new order called the Guardians of the Covenant, made up of mixed-faith clergy.
Impact:
The empire regains stability but remains deeply fractured along religious lines.
The Radiant Covenant survives but is no longer the sole faith, sharing influence with competing religions.
